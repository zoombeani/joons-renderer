Use & modify as you want.

You need Sunflow 0.07.3 and Janino JARs to run joons-renderer from source code. I used Monkstone's flavor of Sunflow. They are included in this git repository. You also need Processing core, gluegen-rt and jogl JARs, which are included in Processing distributions.

Looking to modify the following:
+copy rendered.png to saveFrame function, or achieve similar with jr.saveFrame function
+implement HSB support
